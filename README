Project:
    To provide a convenient GUI for grading student assignments

Directory Assumptions:
    - roster.csv
        The class roster in the following format:
            A tab delimited file containing a first row of headers
            The following headers are special to the system, and must be present

            StandardName: the internal name for this student (see submissions/ section)
            FirstName: the student's first (familiar) name
            LastName:  the student's last (family) name
            UniqueId:  the student's unique identification nuber
                       example: their student id number
            EmailAddress: the student's email address

            Any other columns are not tracked by the system, and do not require having a particular header
            However, it is recommended that any additional headers present are uniquely named

    - rubric.txt
        For each assignment, a rubric must be made in the following format:
        The rubric is line-oriented.
        Major sections look like "SectionName (points):"
        Inside of each section are lines which either add or dock points together with a short description
        Longer commentary is possible via lines which do not start with either a + or -, shown below as (-10)
        For example, a rubric of two sections

        Code Style (80):
        -10 indentation
        -5  improper use of curly braces
        +5  clear control flow

        Worksheet (40):
        -5 algorithm description incomplete
        (-10) use more terminology in your writing

    - submissions/
        A directory containing the student submissions
        Inside this directory is list of directories, one for each student, named with the StandardName
        
    - testing/
        TODO: support automated testing of student submissions
